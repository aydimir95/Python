File I/O is all about writing code that can read from and write to the file itself

List - that store multiple values 

lists are stored in the computer's memory and once the program exits even the context of those disapear but lets give ourselves a starting point:

1. create a simple program names.py that collects people's names
2. write a csv file of those names and read from it 
3. append to the list more names and create a loop 
4. add another column to the csv file and append the house the names are from
5. format the list to make it readable for people by separating the name and the house to their own variables and adding a logical connection - lile the "name" is from "house"
