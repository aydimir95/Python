This repository serves as a personal log to track my progress in learning Python.

August 18, 2024
1. I'm currently working through the CS50 Python course (link: https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022), and I'm excited to be at week 7â€”almost at the finish line!

2. Inspired by what I've learned so far, I decided to challenge myself by building a local LLM using the Ollama model 3.

3. My immediate goal is to complete the CS50 course, finish all the assignments, and earn the Harvard Certificate.

4. Next, I plan to dive into the CS50x course to deepen my understanding of programming as a whole.

5. My long-term ambition is to develop tools that automate tasks in Autodesk Revit and Civil 3D using Python.

6. As a Civil Engineer, my ultimate dream is to create an AI capable of automatically generating intelligent 3D models for Civil Engineering projects.
