This repository is made for me to keep track of my python learning progress.

Currently I'm going through CS50 Python course https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022 

And I'm at week 7, which is almost the end of the course.

So I decided to give it a try and built my own local LLM using ollama model 3.

My plan is to finish the CS50 course, do all the homework, and get the Harvard Certificate.

Then I want to take the CS50x to start understanding programming in general.

And start building tools to automate Autodesk Revit & Civil 3D using python.

I'm a Civil Engineer by trade and my dream is to build an AI that would 3D model Civil Engineering projects automatically.
